List known bugs or missing functionality here.

1. Instructions read: "Folder names should all be lowercase." However, the starter project uses proper case for folder names. 

1. I'm not sure if a linked list should point to the object itself or an abstraction of the object. I have chosen to use a "BaseballCardNode" class to avoid a violation of SRP in which the BaseballCard object owns details regarding the linked-list implementation. 

//needed to remove this
void BaseballCardNode::removeBaseballCard()
{
    if(this->nextName != nullptr)
    {
        this->nextName->setPrevName(*this->prevName);
    }

    if(this->nextYear != nullptr)
    {
        this->nextYear->setPrevYear(*this->prevYear);
    }

    if(this->nextCondition != nullptr)
    {
        this->nextCondition->setPrevCondition(*this->prevCondition);
    }

    if(this->prevName != nullptr)
    {
        this->prevName->setNextName(*this->nextName);
    }

    if(this->prevYear != nullptr)
    {
        this->prevYear->setNextYear(*this->nextYear);
    }

    if(this->prevCondition != nullptr)
    {
        this->prevCondition->setNextCondition(*this->nextCondition);
    }
    this->nextName = nullptr;
    this->nextYear = nullptr;
    this->nextCondition = nullptr;
    this->prevName = nullptr;
    this->prevYear = nullptr;
    this->prevCondition= nullptr;
    delete this->nodeReference;
    this->nodeReference = nullptr;
}
