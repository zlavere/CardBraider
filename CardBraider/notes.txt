List known bugs or missing functionality here.

1. Instructions read: "Folder names should all be lowercase." However, the starter project uses proper case for folder names. TODO: Change directory names to follow naming conventions.

2. I'm not sure if a linked list should point to the object itself or an abstraction of the object. I have chosen to use a "BaseballCardNode" class to avoid a violation of SRP in which the BaseballCard object owns details regarding the linked-list implementation. 
-- Verified in class this is correct, and I think I performed this correctly, leaving just in case.

3. Cancel on Load from a new file, overwrites the file such that the collection is empty regardless of the whether or not the user selected a file.
